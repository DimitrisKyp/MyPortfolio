         <p><strong>1st Lyceum of Neapoli - Class of 2016 - G.P.A: 19.0/20</strong> <br>
          The 1st Neapolis High School was founded in 1986 and was housed
          in the building in which the 1st Neapolis General High School
          operates today. Previously, the school was located in old buildings
          of the former Strebeniotis camp under the name 22nd High School of 
          Thessaloniki (1979-1986), which was a continuation of I Girls' 
          High School of Thessaloniki (1972-1979).
          In 1999, it was renamed 1st Unified High School of Neapolis to
          acquire its current name of 1st General High School of Neapolis
          in 2006. Finally, in 2008 the school acquired the nickname 
          "Nikolaos Papageorgiou" in honor of its benefactor.

              <strong>Linear Circuits / Non-Linear Circuits</strong><br>electric circuit, path for 
              transmitting electric current. An electric circuit includes a device 
              that gives energy to the charged particles constituting the current, 
              such as a battery or a generator; devices that use current, such as 
              lamps, electric motors, or computers; and the connecting wires or 
              transmission lines. Two of the basic laws that mathematically describe 
              the performance of electric circuits are Ohm's law and Kirchhoff's rules.
              Electric circuits are classified in several ways. A direct-current 
              circuit carries current that flows only in one direction. An 
              alternating-current circuit carries current that pulsates back and 
              forth many times each second, as in most household circuits. (For a 
              more-detailed discussion of direct- and alternating-current circuits, 
              see electricity: Direct electric current and electricity: 
              Alternating electric currents.)

              <strong>Network Theory</strong><br>Network theory is the study of 
              graphs as a representation of either symmetric relations or asymmetric 
              relations between discrete objects. In computer science and network 
              science, network theory is a part of graph theory: a network can be 
              defined as a graph in which nodes and/or edges have attributes (e.g. names).
              Network theory has applications in many disciplines including 
              statistical physics, particle physics, computer science, electrical 
              engineering, biology, archaeology, economics, finance, operations research, 
              climatology, ecology, public health, sociology, and neuroscience. Applications 
              of network theory include logistical networks, the World Wide Web, Internet, 
              gene regulatory networks, metabolic networks, social networks, epistemological 
              networks, etc.

              <strong>Chaos Theory</strong><br>Chaos theory, in mechanics and mathematics, 
              the study of apparently random or unpredictable behaviour in systems governed 
              by deterministic laws. A more accurate term, deterministic chaos, suggests a 
              paradox because it connects two notions that are familiar and commonly regarded 
              as incompatible.<br>Chaotic cryptology is the application of the mathematical chaos 
              theory to the practice of the cryptography, the study or techniques used to 
              privately and securely transmit information with the presence of a 
              third-party or adversary.

                <strong>Programming languages Mathematica, C, Python</strong><br>In physics, 
                different theories based on mathematical models provide very precise predictions 
                on how systems behave. Unfortunately, it is often the case that solving the 
                mathematical model for a particular system in order to produce a useful 
                prediction is not feasible. In such cases, numerical approximations are required. Computational 
                physics is the subject that deals with these numerical approximations: 
                the approximation of the solution is written as a finite (and typically large) 
                number of simple mathematical operations (algorithm), and a computer (with the help of 
                a progamming language) is used to perform these operations and compute 
                an approximated solution and respective error.
